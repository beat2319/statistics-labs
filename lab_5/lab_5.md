Lab 5: Fire Frequency in the Colorado Front Range
This lab analyzes patterns in forest fire frequency across different elevation bands and zones in the Colorado Front Range from 1985 to 2019. Using statistical tests like ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and Chi-squared, we investigate whether fire occurrence varies significantly by region and elevation. The analysis includes visualizations and interprets the results in the context of regional fire patterns.
